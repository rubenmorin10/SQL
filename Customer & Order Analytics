#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)

WHERE  price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)
#OR 
SELECT distinct product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB0.JanSales
GROUP BY product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select

FROM BIT_DB0.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

#15 How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT SUM(quantity) as quantity, product
FROM FebSales
where Product Like '%headphone%' 
group by product;
    
#16 What was the average amount spent per account in February? (Hints: For this question, we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account. To multiply, you can use the * symbol, and to divide, you can use the / symbol.)
SELECT avg(quantity*price) AS "Average Price"
FROM BIT_DB0.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB0.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id;

#17 What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).

#18 Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
